# AutonomousPongCannon
The Arduino Scripts from my autonomous pong cannon project

Scripts used to control my cup pong playing robot, "PongLauncherTargetAimShootScript" and "PongBotCircleFitTaubin" are a more complex 
implementation of my algorithm to play the game, including implementing Taubin's circle fitting algorithm to better estimate cup positions 
on the table by fitting a circle to them. "HouseTourPongbotScript" is a more simple demonstration script that simplifies aiming to 
pointing at the closest cup.
