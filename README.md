The Arduino Scripts from my autonomous pong cannon project

Scripts used to control my cup pong playing robot, "PongLauncherTargetAimShootScript" and "PongBotCircleFitTaubin" are a more complex 
implementation of my algorithm to play the game, including implementing Taubin's circle fitting algorithm to better estimate cup positions 
on the table by fitting a circle to them. Credit to Nikolai Chernov for implementation of circle fitting algorithm. "HouseTourPongbotScript" is a more simple demonstration script that simplifies aiming to 
pointing at the closest cup. Link to footage of the robot firing: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cIUepoaP-0mXg6agwWqK5FlxUwrOT6Cp/view?usp=sharing
